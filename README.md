# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Dungeon Crawler CLI

A **text-based adventure game** written in **pure Ruby**, designed as a fun way to refresh and demonstrate Ruby fundamentals ‚Äî OOP, control flow, data structures, and clean CLI architecture.

The project simulates a **turn-based dungeon crawl** where the player explores randomly generated rooms, battles monsters, collects loot, and tries to survive until they find the exit.

---

## üöÄ Overview

**Dungeon Crawler CLI** is built as a modular Ruby project, structured for clarity and scalability.
It can later be extended into a **Rails-powered web app** (with persistent players, leaderboards, and RESTful APIs).

The goal is to:

- Reinforce Ruby fundamentals
- Practice modular design and OOP
- Build a complete, working terminal application
- (Optional) Bridge it into Rails for web integration

## üß© Features (Phase 1 - CLI Core)

- üéÆ **Turn-based gameplay** ‚Äì each move matters
- ‚öîÔ∏è **Combat system** ‚Äì fight goblins, trolls, and dragons
- üß± **Procedural dungeon generation** ‚Äì random room contents
- üí∞ **Inventory and loot** ‚Äì collect gold, weapons, and potions
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Player stats** ‚Äì HP, attack, defense, healing
- üß† **Command system** ‚Äì move, attack, heal, inspect, inventory
- ‚öóÔ∏è **YAML-driven monsters & items** ‚Äì easily configurable data files
- üïπÔ∏è **Clean CLI loop** ‚Äì smooth and readable text-based interactions

---

## üß± Planned Features (Phase 2 - Expansion)

- üè∞ **Multi-level dungeon** with increasing difficulty
- üíæ **Save & Load** game state using YAML serialization
- üé® **Colored text / ASCII art** for immersive visuals
- üß™ **RSpec tests** for game logic and OOP components
- üß≠ **Command aliases** (`n`, `s`, `e`, `w`, `a`, `h`) for faster navigation
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Difficulty modes** (Easy, Normal, Hard)
- üéØ **Special abilities & item types**

---

## üåê Phase 3 - Rails Extension (Optional)

After the CLI version is stable, the project can evolve into a simple **Ruby on Rails web application**, using the CLI core as a foundation.

- üßë‚Äçüíª **Models:** `Player`, `Monster`, `Battle`, `DungeonRoom`
- üåç **Routes:** `/api/start`, `/api/move`, `/api/attack`
- üíæ **Database:** PostgreSQL for persistence
- ‚ö° **Frontend (Optional):** React or ERB for browser-based play

This step ties together backend skills, Rails routing, REST APIs, and full-stack design.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

```
dungeon_crawler/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game.rb # Entry point ‚Äì main game loop
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ player.rb # Player stats and actions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ monster.rb # Enemy classes and combat logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dungeon.rb # Map and dungeon generation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ room.rb # Handles room events and interactions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ item.rb # Loot and items
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ actions.rb # Command parsing and execution
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.rb # Helper functions (formatting, delays)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ monsters.yml # Monster definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ items.yml # Item definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rooms.yml # Optional room templates
```

## üß† Architecture Notes

- **`Game`** is the orchestrator ‚Äî runs the main loop and manages state.
- **`Player`** encapsulates player data and logic.
- **`Dungeon`** manages navigation and current room tracking.
- **`Room`** defines what happens when you enter ‚Äî combat, loot, trap, etc.
- **`Monster`** handles enemy behavior and attacks.
- **`Item`** and **`Inventory`** manage loot and healing.
- **`Actions`** abstracts user commands for clarity.
- **`Utils`** contains optional CLI formatting helpers (e.g., color, delay).
